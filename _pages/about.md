Hi, I’m a **Platform Engineer**. My work focuses on infrastructure automation, Kubernetes-based systems, observability, and reliability, with an emphasis on creating maintainable and secure environments.

I am the author and maintainer of **MetarParser**, an open-source library for parsing and decoding aviation weather reports (METAR and TAF), along with its associated [web application](https://www.metar-taf-decoder.com). This project covers the full lifecycle from library design and API stability to backend services, deployment, and production operation.

In addition, I develop and maintain several **open-source projects**, primarily in **Python** and **Java**, related to backend services, tooling, and automation. I have a strong interest in self-hosted and cloud-native architectures, and I enjoy experimenting with real-world systems to improve performance, resilience, and developer experience.

Technologies I frequently work with include Kubernetes, Docker, Linux, CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code, PostgreSQL, and cloud-native tooling.
